        "description": "The story is set aboard the Megazone 11, a different space colony ship fleet from the Megazone 23 in the 1985 original video anime. Megazone 11's master ships are designed as realistic simulations of Earth cities such as Tokyo, and there is also a satellite ship that is designed to resemble a smaller Japanese provincial city around the year 2020.The protagonist Sakura is an ordinary second-year middle school student who lives aboard that satellite ship. She leads a secret life as part of a singing duo with Eve, a friend she made online. On a master ship, a resistance movement flares up. To achieve independence, they must take control of Tiamat, the system that controls the fleet, but the key to the system was lost in battle 80 years ago.

        "description": "The novel takes place in the summer of 1907, the 40th year of the Meiji era. 15-year-old Inako Momokawa lives in the Fushimi area of Kyoto, and is the second daughter of a sake brewer. Nothing she does ever comes out right, and she receives a scolding from her father every day. Her only relief is the trust she places in her prayers to the gods. One day while at Fushimi Inari shrine, she meets a freewheeling young man named Kihachi Sakamoto. He rejects the gods, and boasts of the incoming age of electricity. The topic of marriage suddenly comes up in Inako's household. Her father is one-sidedly making all the decisions for her, and Inako is about to give up hope. It is then that Kihachi draws out Inako's true feelings of wanting to run away from her family. The only way to stop her marriage is to find an unusual book called the \"Electricity Catalog.\" The book is a prediction book about electricity that Kihachi wrote when he was a child, but his older brother Seiroku took the book, and its current whereabouts are unknown. Inako and Kihachi together go in search of the book across Kyoto and Shiga prefectures.(Source: Anime News Network)",

        "description": "The film is the dying wish of Japanese-American animation director Jimmy Murakami, who passed away in 2004 at 80 years old. Murakami is known for the animated adaptations of When the Wind Blows and The Snowman, both books by Raymond Briggs. During World War II, Murakami was imprisoned at the Tule Lake War Relocation Center internment camp. He had told friends that he wanted his last work to be themed on Hiroshima.Murakami had wanted the film to be based on the life's work of historian Shigeaki Mori, who has spent more than 40 years gathering details on the 12 U.S. bomber crew members and prisoners of war who were killed during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945. Mori is himself a survivor of the bombing of Hiroshima, and is the subject of a recent documentary titled Paper Lanterns, which launched digitally and on home video on August 7.Hiroshima: The Last Summer Rose, based on Mori's books, will tell a story of an American prisoner of war and a Japanese nursing student who fall in love, but are torn apart by the atomic bombing. The title comes from the Irish folk song \"The Last Rose of Summer,\" which is itself the basis for the famous Japanese song \"Niwa no Chigusa.",

        "description": "Yoshiharu Kawaura is part of the first generation of humans born on the Moon and has a wild dream: to be a part of the elite who live in the center of Lunar City. As a homeless teenage runaway with only meager savings and an irreverent attitude, he hides and sleeps in internet cafes while trading stocks on the Lunar Stock Exchange. With his hard work and natural intuition of the market, his seed money of one thousand mools grows to seventy-two thousand mools in a matter of months, with the end to his streak nowhere in sight.Unfortunately, despite the Moon being an economic paradise with limited regulations and low taxes, street urchins like Yoshiharu must always remain on the lookout. After an especially close call with the police, he takes refuge in a church owned and ran by Risa, a part-time worker at a Chinese restaurant. In a stroke of fate, also staying at the church is Hagana, a cold girl with mean eyes and genius-level mathematical abilities. Yoshiharu—now assuming the pseudonym Haru—immediately sees Hagana's potential as a quantitative analyst and establishes a partnership with her for a virtual stock trading competition known to be a ticket into the financial community. As their growing success both in and out of the competition leads to more people investing in Haru and his goal, will he be able to keep his cool and stay on top of the ever-volatile market?",

Recently, however, stills from the film Urashima Taro released by Nikkatsu in 1918 have been discovered in a magazine. These stills do not appear in [this] film, so we are led to believe that this film is not the work produced by Kitayama at the Nikkatsu studio.(Source: Japanese Animated Film Classics, forum.bcdb.com)",

After enjoying a nice, long life of 94 years, he was looking forward to shutting his eyes for the last time. He was, therefore, understandably upset when he woke up again in an empty space, devoid of memories, with a young girl in a tunic rambling on and on about how she's God. So, he did what any reasonable person would have done under those circumstances: he sent the girl flying with a kick to the face. It turned out that the girl was indeed God, and she was in a pinch. She urgently needed someone to do some interdimensional Resource smuggling, and Renya fit the bill. His mission: cross the boundary into another world, then chill for a few decades. God would handle the rest. To sweeten the deal, she offered him an eighteen-year-old body and a whole laundry list of ludicrously powerful skills, yet he remained hesitant. Then, she mentioned the food — an exotic world comes with exotic delicacies — and this sealed the deal. The next thing he knew, he was standing in a foreign land, younger, stronger, and more clueless than ever. Will he survive this world? And more importantly, will the world survive him?(Source: J-Novel Club)Note: Cancelled due to fan backlash on content in source material.",

According to Shuichi Saito, the withdrawn boyfriend of teenager Kirie Goshima, their town is haunted not by a person or being but by a pattern: uzumaki, the spiral, the hypnotic secret shape of the world. It manifests itself in small ways: seashells, ferns, whirlpools in water, whirlwinds in air. And in large ways: the spiral marks on people's bodies, the insane obsessions of Shuichi's father, the voice from the cochlea in your inner ear. As the madness spreads, the inhabitants of Kurouzu-cho are pulled ever deeper, as if into a whirlpool from which there is no return...(Source: Viz Media)",

        "description": "There is a painting called ‘The Shaman Sorceress’ left at ‘my’ home by a mute girl and her father. As is always the case, this picture is worth a thousand words. The story behind the painting begins with a shaman named Mohwa who has been living with her mute daughter Nang-Yi and practicing shamanism her entire life. One day her son Wook-Yi, who had been gone for several years to study returns home, but as a converted Christian. This sparks a conflict between Wook-Yi and Mohwa and drives the family into tragedy.",

However, a group of \"cyborgs\" has become weaponized, and a series of riots have occurred, plunging the galaxy into unprecedented turmoil. The culprit behind is a high-tech criminal organization codenamed \"Illum\".In order to fight this evil force, the \"Tacit Blue\" investigation team led by Carl was established. They began a life-and-death confrontation with Illum, and discovered the shocking conspiracy behind the cyborg riot... During this time, each member of Tacit Blue had to face their own past and scars, and learn to face and redeem themselves, all while saving the galaxy.",

But everybody knows magicians are born, not made, and Coco was not born with a gift for magic. Resigned to her un-magical life, Coco is about to give up on her dream to become a witch … until the day she meets Qifrey, a mysterious, traveling magician. After secretly seeing Qifrey perform magic in a way she’s never seen before, Coco soon learns what everybody “knows” might not be the truth, and discovers that her magical dream may not be as far away as it may seem...

However, without much talent for the job, Rentt finds himself stuck hunting slimes and goblins for meager amounts of coin every day. Little does he know, all this is about to change when he comes across a seemingly undiscovered path in the Labyrinth of the Moon's Reflection. What awaits him at the end of the path, however, is neither treasure nor riches, but a legendary dragon that wastes no time swallowing him whole! Waking up a short time later, Rentt finds himself not quite dead, but not very alive either—he is nothing more than a pile of bones! Armed with nothing but his trusty sword, tool belt, and ghoulish new looks, Rentt sets off on his quest as a newly reborn Skeleton to achieve Existential Evolution, hoping to one day return to civilization with a more human form.Will Rentt succeed, or will the labyrinth consume him for the rest of his un-death...?(Source: J-Novel Club)",

Not so for melancholic author Osamu Dazai, who would quite literally prefer to drop dead. Video games haven’t even been invented yet when he gets yanked into another world in 1948. Really, all the fantastical adventure he keeps running into is just getting in the way of his poetic dream of finding the perfect place to die. But no matter how much he risks his hide, everything seems to keep turning out okay. Follow a miserable hero like no other in this cheerfully bleak isekai comedy!(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

        "description": "From classmates to brother and sister, living under the same roof.After his father's remarriage, Asamura Yuuta ends up getting a new stepsister, coincidentally the number one beauty of the school year, Ayase Saki. Having learned important values when it comes to man-woman relationships through the previous ones of their parents, they promise each other not to be too close, not to be too opposing, and to merely keep a vague and comfortable distance. On one hand, Saki, who has worked in solitude for the sake of her family, doesn't know how to properly rely on others, whereas Yuta is unsure of how to really treat her. Standing on fairly equal ground, these two slowly learn the comfortable sensation of living together. Their relationship slowly evolves from being strangers the more the days pass. Eventually, this could end up in a story about love for all we know.",

Due to their appearance, they were dubbed \"Mecha-ude,\" as when fused, they bore a striking resemblance to mechanized limbs.Through an involuntary partnership, average middle schooler Hikaru Amatsuga works alongside the Mecha-ude Arma, who is an extremely rare and special existence. To protect Arma, the resistance group ARMS assigns the dual Mecha-ude user Aki Murasame to follow him wherever he goes. However, she is also looking for a mysterious Snake-Type Mecha-ude wielder, who has put many of her comrades in a critical state.Behind the scenes, an organization known as the Kagami Group is searching for the mythical \"Trigger Arm,\" a Mecha-ude said to grant unlimited power. When Aki's life is threatened by this group, Hikaru must team up with Arma to find the coursage to fight back and, along the way, learn that his life will never be ordinary again.

        "description": "Shimokawa Hekoten drew with chalk on a blackboard with the help of Tenkatsu (Color Motion Picture CO., Ltd.), and created the background and characters. Overlapping parts were erased with white paint, and the first animation of Japan was completed through repeated shooting.This work is considered to be the first recorded professional animation of Asia, it also contains the first dramatic structure in which a main character has a humorous name. (Source: CAPSULE Blog: Total Color List Production Committee)There is a lot of speculation if this movie was in fact ever released. It was screened several times at a movie company, but it is said that even the author, Shimokawa, was not satisfied with the work due to the sloppy movement. There is however, no evidence that it actually released in theaters. The name of the work does not exist in the list of theater screenings in Magazine \"Kinema record\" or \"Movie Review\" for Janurary 1917. Also since there is so few materials that mention this film and no copy has ever been found, the contents of the story are completely unknown. Some even speculate that was released at a later date in 1917 under a different name.",

        "description": "Short movie produced by the first generation animator Kitayama Seitarou. Based on the Japanese fairy tale Hanasaka Jiijii, also called Hanasaka Jiisan. An old childless couple loved their dog. One day, it dug in the garden, and they found a box of gold pieces there. A neighbor thought the dog must be able to find treasure, and managed to borrow the dog. When it dug in his garden, there were only bones, and he killed it. He told the couple that the dog had just dropped dead. They grieved and buried it under the fig tree where they had found the treasure. One night, the dog's master dreamed that the dog told him to chop down the tree and make a mortar from it. He told his wife, who said they must do as the dog asked. When they did, the rice put into the mortar turned into gold. The neighbor borrowed it, but the rice turned to foul-smelling berries, and he and his wife smashed and burned the mortar.That night, in a dream, the dog told his master to take the ashes and sprinkle them on certain cherry trees. When he did, the cherry trees came into bloom, and the Daimyo (feudal landlord), passing by, marveled and gave him many gifts. The neighbor tried to do the same, but the ashes blew into the Daimyo's eyes, so he threw him into prison; when he was let out, his village would not let him live there anymore, and he could not, with his wicked ways, find a new home.(Source: Wikipedia)",

The pictures are drawn with a simple technique using only lines. Despite being a silent film, it is designed to incorporate musical elements. For example, the lyrics of the song The Hare and the Tortoise are represented as musical notes coming out of the characters' mouths. The unique backgrounds remind us of scenery in some foreign country rather than a landscape used in an old Japanese folk tale. This film is one of Sanae Yamamoto's earliest works and is described in documents as being produced by Kitayama Eiga Seisakusho owned by Seitaro Kitayama, Yamamoto's teacher.(Japanese Animated Film Classics)",

There is a brief live-action shot of the sea swelling before the film returns to its animated fantasy world when a beautiful girl appears on the beach and lures him into the waves, transforming into the legendary turtle and carrying him beneath the surface to an undersea kingdom of fish and squid. Here he is welcomed by a bevy of kimono-wearing lovelies who lead him to a stately court full of musicians and dancers. As a ballerina pirouettes on the palace floor in front of him, he is plied with alcohol and handed a small gift box, before being escorted to a giant scallop shell that rises through the water taking him back to the surface. When he returns home, he finds he has aged so much that his wife and son no longer recognise him. He opens the gift box and a hideous demon springs from it and squashes him beneath its fists, at which point the man wakes up, and realising that the events of this story have all been a terrible nightmare, hurries out to work, alerted to the potential dangers of a life spent in idle daydreaming.(Source: midnighteye.com)",

        "description": "The monk Xuanzang goes on a journey to western India to get the Mahayana Buddhist scriptures. In the middle of the journey, Xuanzang helps Sun Wukong who was confined in a large rock by Guanyin for being too full of mischief. Sun Wukong, who becomes Xuanzang's pupil, punishes a pig monster who is attacking a girl. The pig becomes a new pupil disciple named Zhu Bajie. A kappa (water imp) is also renamed Sha Wujing and becomes a pupil. When Sun Wukong confines a monster in a large stone and throws the ball he obtained from it, a holy mountain topped with snow appears. It is the Ho-den hall pagoda where the Mahayana Buddhist scriptures are stored. When Xuanzang asks Tathagata Buddha to grant him the sacred scriptures, Nyorai-sama says the scriptures will be delivered by a dragon cart. (Source: animation.filmarchives.jp)",

        "description": "Komori | The BatOnce upon a time, the birds and the beasts fought each other in a war. It was a terrible conflict, and the clever bats would side with the birds when the birds were looking victorious, and then they would become allies of the beasts when that side was winning battles. At last the war came to an end, the two parties reached an amicable settlement, and a great party of friendship was held. But when it came to the turn of the bats to perform in the program, their fence-straddling tactics were exposed, and everyone refused to associate with them. Since that time, the bats have been too ashamed to show their faces during the day, coming out only at night to flit silently around.",
